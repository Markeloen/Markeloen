### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# About Me
I am a **Master of Science** student at **McMaster** University, specializing in **Computer Engineering** with a strong background in **Data Science** and **Algorithms**. My passion lies in coding, particularly in languages like **C++** and **Python**, where I enjoy solving complex problems and optimizing algorithms for real-world applications.

# Current Projects
## 1. Free Space Optical Link Simulation <br>

Currently, I am involved in a challenging project focused on simulating a Free Space Optical (FSO) link from a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite to the ground. This project presents engineering-heavy computation challenges, and I am utilizing **GPU parallel** computation techniques to optimize and solve these intricate problems. My work on this project involves pushing the boundaries of technology to establish high-speed, reliable communication links via FSO.<br>
## 2. Collaborating with the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) <br>

I am actively collaborating with the **National Research Council of Canada (NRC)** on the *AI4D* project. In this role, I am applying machine learning techniques to tackle various adaptive optics problems. This project offers an exciting opportunity to use artificial intelligence in a scientific context, and it further enriches my expertise in machine learning and data science.
